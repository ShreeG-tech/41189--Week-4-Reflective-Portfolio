# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio
## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
This fourth week I learnt about system dynamics models, and how as individuals, we are driven by feedbacks, time delays and nonlinearities. Systems are defined by their interrelationships and their functionality or potential to work. I also learnt about network models, and how they are comprised of interconnecting nodes that form structures of various systems. Furthermore, I learnt about Agent-based models which simulate real and artificial societies. This all builds op upon last week’s lesson on Rational, Behavioural, Rule-based, and Signalling models, and how they influence people’s behaviour, decisions, and their ability to conceal or reveal information, how they add value and power, and finally, how they collaborate in groups to solve problems.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week’s learning’s taught me a lot about the new aforementioned models.  Systems dynamics models are tools to look deeply into dynamic systems with interdependencies that involve feedbacks and delays. Systems are defined by their interrelationships and their functionality or potential-we see these in both the private and public sectors. System dynamics can represent the features of — stocks, flows, sources, and sinks. System structure is the source of common system behaviour, as is the structure of anything determining its behaviour. We all reveal ourselves as continuous series of events over time, with all the archetypes and traps-and systems are no exceptions, as they operate in the same way.

In Network models, we look at:
- Their structure in terms of the number of nodes, and how they’re all connected
- Their logic in the sense, What rules do people use to form networks? 
- Their functionality -What does the network do with an especially emergent functionality?

Network graphs have the size of which is the number of nodes or edges. There is a density here, where it’s an edges ratio to the number of nodes in the model itself, and the diameter measures the shortest maximum distances between the node pairs. The shortest path calculates how many edges there are between 2 nodes and their distance is then weighted upon. There are then these sub graphs that contain the subset of nodes in the network, along with their edges. The parts of the sub graph are disconnected from everyone and everything else. And there are islands that only keep the edges that have larger weights. This kind of reminds me of coordinates from school, where we had to find a certain location by matching up a letter and a number, say D1. This also brings into mind the connect the dots activity, where dots have to be connected correctly, to form the bigger picture in order to make sense of the whole thing. 

There are 3 logics of network formation, and they are:
-	Random which connects 2 nodes
-	Preferential attachment, where there is a probability of a new connection proportional to a certain degree
-Small world where you create them in various ways 

Agent-based Models(ABM) are Artificial Society Modelling, which involve the use of Agents, Environment, Rules, Social structures / Patterns rising from the bottom. It is a production of social science. The rationale behind this model, is that it seeks to comprehend how to better manage the system, and it involves the simple behavioural rules of separation, alignment and cohesion, which = emergent behaviours we see / want to see in the real world? This all enhances our ability to influence and learn. As I have thus learnt so far this past month, is that Complex systems involve many actors, multiple viewpoints, cross-scale interactions, thresholds/nonlinearities, and it always has evolving/adaptive processes. 

Alongside ABM is Participatory modelling, where the agents’ rules originate from i.e. surveys, interviews, published models and orally (directly from the agents). Participatory modelling is:
- A type of process that works with all the  so-called “experts”, stakeholders, governments, regulators and communities in creating scientific models 
- They bring out stakeholder knowledge: tacit + scientific-and stakeholders need these models
- Levelling the playing field: by allowing for co-construction, co-learning-everyone works together here
- Focused: their models are probably more likely to help people in their decision making

We can see participatory modelling playing out in the COVID-19 pandemic this year, as everyone scrambles to learn as much of from it as they can, to educate the public about the seriousness of the disease, in the hopes that they will practice social distancing, the wearing of masks and go through with the consistent hygienic practices of hand washing and disinfecting. Additionally, to also encourage them to get tested if they visited any areas that had reported cases, and commence self-isolation.

### What insights have I gained?

The insights I gained from this week’s content are that most problems we see these days are driven by feedbacks, time delays, and nonlinearities. We have to see what structures contain hidden behaviours, and what conditions  enable those behaviours—and, where possible, to sort out the structures and conditions to reduce the probability of destructive behaviours and to encourage the possibility of beneficial ones-now we always hear about, particularly when it comes to the justice system. We all have mental model, that is we do all have an “informal” mental representation of how something works. We cannot keep all of the details of the world in our brains-too much stress to remember. This is why we build models to simplify the complex into understandable chunks-sort of like breaking down a large assessment into manageable sizes for yourself and/or the team to tackle day by day and week by week. 
Our mental models can of course lead to cognitive biases come, which then spring from our mental shortcuts or heuristics. These cognitive biases can also come from flaws in our thinking that distort our perceptions and make decisions, and that even systematic logical thought, can create the occasional error.  So we try to manage and improve these mental systems between our Bugworld, where things are loosely connected, independent, where changing interactions + behaviour, makes it unpredictable but adaptive. Then we have our Cogworld, where things are interconnected, dependent, and fixed interactions + behaviour makes it predictable, but however, it can’t adapt to external changes. Wow our brains are very complex. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
For me, my perceived strengths are that I know how I learn, and that is via the visual way. I need to see the information at hand in order to process it. Especially for this subject, I can utilise graphs, charts, maps, diagrams, and other forms of visual stimulation and obtain information from them. However, my weakness is that I only rely on the visual style of learning, and dismiss the other learning styles of kinaesthetic which I hear is very useful for building actual models that are tactile and also auditory learning, in which you learn through listening. All learning styles are valuable for all things, so open mindedness on my part is imperative. 

### What were the challenges I encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges I observed this week are how can different systems and their corresponding models possibly be modelled in programming software such as Anaconda-Python. I believe I can handle them by consulting online resources available on YouTube and Geeks for Geeks or Stack Overflow and other likes. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is to seriously buckle down and not be a passive visual learner. I need to be actively involved in my self-learning journey and treat it as a lifelong commitment, because it is certainly a process that spans the course of a lifetime. I can do this by learning from other sources besides university.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory I feel that has proved to be most useful for this week is the casual loop diagrams as one of the ways in depicting system dynamics. These types of diagrams graphically symbolise the relationships between quantities of variables. These variables can be poles apart from each other such as ice creams sales and murder rates. There are reinforcing loops and balancing loops. Reinforcing loops can include variables such as consistent procrastination can lead to added stress, and balancing loops for example the rate of sugar consumption balances health concerns. I can definitely relate to those ones. 
Another theory from this week that I also found interesting is the one of cultural, where it goes through the heuristic concept of culture in operational terms when it comes to rule breaking and being a law abiding citizen in demonstrating good, moral character.
